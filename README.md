## Overview
In late January 2020, the first known case of the novel Coronavirus was documented in the United States, and on December 14th of the same year, an FDA emergency approved vaccine produced by pharmaceuticals manufacturer Pfizer was given to its first non-trial patient, a healthcare worker in New York. The vaccine was created in record time, less than a year after the discovery of the virus, and after the deaths of over 300,000 Americans, and over 1,000,000 worldwide. However, the world seems divided into those who are ready to receive the inoculation, and those who aren't. According to the CDC, the amount of people who need protection from a specific disease varies by disease, and the New York Times states "Public health officials estimate that 70 to 75 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated before people can start moving freely in society again" ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/well/live/covid-vaccine-questions.html#link-4355ea14)). And in the United States, the most recent Gallup poll released November 17th suggests that still only 58% of Americans say they would take a COVID-19 vaccine [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/325208/americans-willing-covid-vaccine.aspx). 

While vaccines and vaccinations have been a hotly debated political topic for many in the US, diving into the realm of medical freedoms and the measures available to a government in order to protect its citizens from public health concerns, none have been as widespread and polarized as COVID-19. So when a global pandemic and a record breaking vaccine occur in the same year as one of the country's most contentious and hotly debated presidential elections, sentiments are sure to be high, and not least of all on Twitter. What is at the core of this divide? And how might government officials and medical professionals be able to address the lack of faith in a vaccine in the current cultural moment? These are the questions I hope to address with natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## Business Problem

Using the data available from Twitter, I wanted to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and help find insights as to how people are feeling about a COVID-19 vaccine. Twint
